## Overview

Sarcasm detection in multilingual text (especially code-mixed languages like Hinglish) is a challenging task due to the informal nature of social media posts. This project aims to build a **machine learning model** to classify text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The model is trained on a dataset of Hinglish social media posts and deployed as a **Streamlit web application**.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Cleans text by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
  - Handles code-mixed text (Hindi + English) written in Roman script.
  - Removes stopwords in both Hindi and English.

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Uses **TF-IDF** for text vectorization.
  - Extracts **sentiment features** (polarity and subjectivity) using TextBlob.

- **Model**:
  - Trains a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier for sarcasm detection.
  - Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Deployment**:
  - Deploys the model as a **Streamlit web application**.
  - Allows users to input text and get real-time predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Hinglish social media posts labeled as **sarcastic** or **non-sarcastic**. The dataset is preprocessed to handle code-mixed text and extract relevant features.

### Example Data

| **Text**                                      | **Label**       |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| "Haan bilkul, ye toh bahut hi useful feature hai. üòè" | Sarcastic       |
| "Mujhe ye movie bahut pasand aayi. üòä"        | Non-Sarcastic   |
| "Oh sure, because waking up at 5 AM is my favorite hobby. üôÑ" | Sarcastic       |
